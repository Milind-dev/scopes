    <h1> 1 one </h1>
    <p> for(var i=0 to 9;i++);
        settimeout going to web apis and wait for some before run event loop, 
        print 0 t0 9 values but here var then its global variable it not give error it access outside
        after print 0 to 9 then event loop runs which is inside webapis going to loop and run to console.
        and print 6 times
    </p>
    <h1> 2 one </h1>
    <p>for(let = 0 to 9;i++)
        let runs all values 0 to 9; but here 1 clause if console print out similarly event loop runs after end console. and print 123456
         </p>
    <p>why because when its goes outside let reinitialized 0 loop that why print 123456 its not happen with var</p>
